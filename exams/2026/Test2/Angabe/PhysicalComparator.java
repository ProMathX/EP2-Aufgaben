/**
 * A comparator for {@link Physical} objects.

 * <p>This interface defines a total ordering on {@code Physical} objects.

 * such as position or radius.</p>
 *
 * <p>The comparison must be consistent and transitive. That is, for all
 * {@code a}, {@code b}, and {@code c}:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code compare(a, b) < 0} implies {@code a} is considered less than {@code b}</li>
 *   <li>{@code compare(a, b) == 0} implies {@code a} and {@code b} are considered equal
 *       with respect to this ordering</li>
 *   <li>{@code compare(a, b) > 0} implies {@code a} is considered greater than {@code b}</li>
 *   <li>If {@code compare(a, b) > 0} and {@code compare(b, c) > 0}, then
 *       {@code compare(a, c) > 0}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Typical implementations may order {@code Physical} objects by their
 * x-coordinate, y-coordinate, radius, or combinations thereof.</p>
